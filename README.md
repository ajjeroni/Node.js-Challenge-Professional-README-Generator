# Node.js-Challenge-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

For this task students had to create a command-line application that dynamically generated a high quality README using Node.js.

This task was really difficult, as Node.js is brand new to me. I used the help of the internet, such as chatGPT, forums, github, and learning assistants. Seeing overall how all worked out is amazing and exapanded my knowledge on Node.JS, API's and NPM's. 

## Installation

git clone the repo

Run npm install to install npm packages 

Run application by entering node index.js in the command line

## Usage

Once prompted to answer README questions, answer as you will.

The README file will then be completed at the end of the prompts.
